\title{Utility to split a VCF file into chunks}
\usage{
split_vcf_multiple_file(vcf_file, outputdir = "./", nb_files = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf_file}{path to a vcf file (gziped or not)}

\item{outputdir}{Output directory to save the splitted vcf}
}
\value{
a character vector with the names of the splitted files.
}
\description{
This function is used internally in the pipeline filterVCF.R but can be called by user.
The function will split any vcf file into equal chunks depending on the
nb_files argument. However if the gziped VCF file is larger than 2Gb then
chunks of 5.000.000 lines are created by default. This function is intended
to be used with very large VCF (20-100Gb) file resulting from a calling of
all sites in the genome. Note however that is not compatible with the GVCF
format of GATK with ranges to represent invariant chunks.
