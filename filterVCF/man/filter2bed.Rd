\title{Save logical vector to BED file}
\usage{
filter2bed(filter, filter_name, vcf_bed_GRange, outputdir = ".",
  output_name, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{filter}{the logical vector created by a filter function}

\item{filter_name}{the name of the filter}

\item{vcf_bed_GRange}{A GRange object with the position of the VCF corresponding to the filter}

\item{outputdir}{= "." the output directory to save the file to}

\item{output_name}{the name of the BED file to save}

\item{...}{<what param does>}
}
\value{
Write to file
}
\description{
This function write a BED file from a filter create with a filter function
that output a logical the same size as vcf. The GRanges from the vcf must be
provided as the filter does not have information on the chr and position but
match the one of the vcf. You can use the function vcf2Grange(vcfR) to
produce this file.

vcf_bed_GRange <- vcf2Grange(vcfR)
gt <- extract_gt_ff(vcfR)
filter_for_missing <- create_filter_missing <- function(gt, allowed_missing_threshold = 0.2)
filter2bed(filter_for_missing, "missing_0.2", vcf_bed_GRange, output_name = "filter_missing_0.2.bed")
